# <p align=center> NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Program TEST PAGE  </p>

Welcome to the test NCPI GitHub page! 

The NCPI program is a partnership between multiple NIH-supported participating systems (currently AnVIL, BioData Catalyst, CRDC, dbGaP, and Kids First) developing and implementing technical standards to enable interoperability and facilitate a federated data ecosystem.

The purpose of this page is to serve as a technical hub for the NCPI community including providing:
  - Information on the current interoperability work that is occuring
  - A central location to find tutorials to enable new members of the NCPI community to perform interoperability-focused work
  - Introductions and links to the services and tools that are fundamental to NCPI


The following table provides a quick overview of the organization of the NCPI GitHub
| <p align=center>Repository</p>|<p align=center>Description</p>|
|--------|---------------|
|[Interoperability Projects](https://github.com/NCPI-test/NCPI-Interoperability-Projects-Test)|Current NCPI Interoperability Projects|
|[NCPI FHIR Implementation Guide 2](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-ig-2?tab=readme-ov-file)| Welcome to NCPI FHIR IG 2. The goal for this repository is to relaunch the IG project with a clearer focus, an explicit style guide using the current tools including Sushi v3.|
|[NCPI FHIR Shiny Browser](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-shiny-browser)|Includes some example R Shiny applications and supporting functions that allow browsing and parsing FHIR objects.|
|[Locutus](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/locutus)|Locutus provides the backend for a web based terminology mapping tool in the very early stages of development. The goal of the application is to provide a collaborative environment to harmonize dataset terms with public ontologies such as MeSH, HPO and others.|
|[NCPI FHIR Client](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-fhir-client)|Provide basic fhir client with built-in modular authentication|
|[HAPI Dev](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/HAPI-Dev)|Provides a simple helper to launch a local FHIR server that persists using local storage and has some pre-defined defaults built in.|
|[NCPI Whistler](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/ncpi-whistler)|NCPI Whistler provides a complete pipeline to transform research data tables into FHIR resources loaded into a FHIR Server using a combination of standard Python scripting, Whistle and the standard FHIR Rest API for loading data into the target FHIR server.|
|[NCPI Whistler Tutorial](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/NCPI-Whistler-Tutorial)|This tutorial is intended to provide a step-by-step for creating a project to transform research data into FHIR resources and (optionally) load those resources into a FHIR server.|
|[Dockerized Whistle](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/dockerized-whistle)|Contains a single docker image suitable to produce a fully functional whistle image and a shell script to make it behave like the actual application would without having to provide the various arguments required for docker to find and call the image.|
